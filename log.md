**Today's Progress**: Started with 30 days of code on hacckerank,currently on day 8. Target to finish it off this week

**Thoughts** This month's target should be acheiving 5 stars in DSA on hackkerank, and get a feel of competitive coding contest.

### Day 2: May 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Tried my first official competitive coding contest.

**Thoughts**  I couldn't solve a single question in 75 mins. But i wennt through other's solutions and acted on my mistakes. Also understood various concepts and watched top coder's competitive coding libraries. Overall pretty informative day !
